    "# Key Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike R which has data frames as a built in data type, the Python language requires us to load a package called pandas which endows Python with dataframe-like capability. Think of data frames as being a generlization of the table format so favored by Excel enthusiasts the world over. Tabular data is easy on the human eye because generally speaking each row relates to a single observation (not always) and each column represents some tpye of measurement of attribute of that observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Excel comparison, a single dataframe can be considered as a single \"worksheet\" although one could have a structure in Python (like a dictionary or list) which could contain one or more data frames. However, we usually restrict our attention to a single dataframe at any given time. We can create dataframes ourselves though it's more common for us to get them by reading in files such as .csv files or even Excel files since Python allows us to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are different ways in which data arrives such as by webscraping or by querying a database. It's also possible that we might use an Application Programming Interface (API) to get data in which case the data might be returned in JSON or XML format which would then require us to parse it into something more convenient. The summary is that we can't always count on data being in tabular format though frequently it is. We might have to massage the data into a format on its way to becoming a data frame. Let's look at a couple of examples."

    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through some basic examples. First up we'll review lists. A list is a container of one or more values in some type of presumed order. That is, we talk about things like the \"first element\", \"second element\" and so on until the \"last element\" is reached. Also, the actual list values themselves could be of different types which means that the list can contain a mixture of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples are not necessarily reflective of immediately practical situations but are contrived to make clear certain points which will be useful to know once you start looking at structures returned by scikit-learn. Knowing how to manage lists and dictionaries winds up being very important to get the information you want when you are accessing the quality of a model. "

A distinct advantage of using dictionaries is that we can name the elements using an intutiive label if we so desire.\n",

As for our interests, the larger point here is that we now have what appears to be a dictionary although it is also JSON. We can parse this information into a dataframe and work with much easier there as long as we understand the process isn't perfect. Note that the tags column can have a list with multiple values. We might want to make other columns to hold tags or somehow make the number of tags symmetrial. "

Pandas has two functions called [**loc**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html) and [**iloc**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html) which are commonly used to access information residing in data frames. There are some shortcuts that don't require the use of either although in my opinion it's best to use one or the other until you become more proficient with pandas dataframe subsetting."

We can \"Split\" or \"group\" the data frame by a grouping factor which is the name of one of the columns. This is useful to split data into groups and implement some function over thowe gorups. We can also (re)combine this information into another structure. We can also apply some statistical summary functions to each group. Let's do some grouping of the Sales data and apply some summary functions to help us understand the data"
